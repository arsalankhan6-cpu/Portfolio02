<!--This project was created for the INFR3120 Web & Script Programming course.
The goal of the assignment was to make a personal portfolio website using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS templates, and then host it online.

What I Did
Installed and set up Node.js and Express using npm install express
Created an Express project structure and used server.js to run the server
Installed and used EJS (npm install ejs) to render pages on the server
Created separate pages including Home, About, Projects, and Contact
Used EJS partials for the header and footer so I don’t repeat code on every page
Connected each page using Express routes in routes/index.js
Included Bootstrap for layout and styling using a CDN link
Added Font Awesome icons using CDN for GitHub and LinkedI icons
Added my profile picture and a short bio
Added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages
Listed projects I worked on (web, networking, and programming projects)
Put all CSS, images, and JS files inside the public folder so Express can serve them
Tested the website locally using npm start to make sure it runs on localhost:3000
Used Git commands to add, commit, and push changes to GitHub
Made multiple commits showing the development process
Deployed the website online using Render and used prcess.env.PORT for hosting
